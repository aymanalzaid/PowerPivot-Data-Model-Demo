# PowerPivot-Data-Model-Demo
Demo files for a mini-lecture on creating a data model in PowerPivot using Excel.
## Overview
This repository includes three separate Excel files:

- `Customers.xlsx`: Contains sample customer information.
- `Products.xlsx`: Contains sample product details.
- `Sales.xlsx`: Contains sample sales transaction data.

These files are used to demonstrate how to:
1.  Activate the PowerPivot add-in in Excel.
2.  Import data from multiple Excel files into the PowerPivot Data Model.
3.  Create relationships between tables (Customers <-> Sales, Products <-> Sales).
4.  Build a PivotTable using the unified Data Model to gain cross-table insights (e.g., Sales by Customer City and Product Category).

## How to Use
1.  **Download the Excel files:** Click on each of the `.xlsx` files in this repository (`Customers.xlsx`, `Products.xlsx`, `Sales.xlsx`) and then click the 'Download' button for each.
2.  **Open in Excel:** Ensure you have Excel with the PowerPivot add-in installed.
3.  **Follow the Demonstration:** Refer to the video lecture for a step-by-step guide on using these files to build a PowerPivot Data Model and create insights.
